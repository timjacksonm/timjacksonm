                I like to tinker with code and explore new ideas, usually just for fun. By day, I'm a software engineer,
                but I enjoy keeping things light and creative on the side.

                Here is a project I've kept alive over time: a full-stack simulation of Conway's Game of Life.
                It’s
                simple, nerdy, and kind of hypnotic.

                My most recent sprint of inspiration was diving into how interactive maps work. I ended up using
                LeafletJS
                to create a tilemap of a game from the past Darkfall Online. It’s a bit of a digital artifact now, as
                the
                game no longer exists and a high resolution image of the map is difficult to find.

                At work, I’ve recently been leading the design of a bulk postcard creation tool, that supports fully
                personalized messages through dynamic tokens. Before that, I focused on improving a user import system
                and developing a flexible CSV reporting feature that allows users to generate and export detailed data
                on
                demand.

                Looking ahead, I’m aiming to deepen my understanding of software architecture, especially as we move
                toward
                microservices.

                Outside of the 9-to-5, I’ve been exploring Godot, a game engine that caught my interest. I’ve started
                drafting a game design document for a castle siege PvP game. It’s still early with some concepts, but
                I’m enjoying the process and learning as I go.
